- 👋 Hi, I’m @capacitor-opensource-plugins
- 👀 I’m interested in ...

   hybrid mobile apps, particularly Quasar Framework, Framework7 and Ionic Framework, all running with Ionic Capacitor.
   
   Also interested in React Native, but have a preference for Quasar (Vue 3), Ionic (Svelte and Vue) and Framework7 (Svelte, Vue, vanilla JS).
   
   Very interested in fast apps, particularly those built with Svelte where reactivity is built-in and there's no interpreting code at runtime overhead.
   
   Svelte is faster than Angular, Vue and React, and while on the subject of compile ahead of time, I also like Riot.JS (use cli to compile ahead of time instead of compiling components at run time).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

  more about Swift for native iOS plugins (Capacitor).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

  all good open source projects!

- 📫 How to reach me ...
